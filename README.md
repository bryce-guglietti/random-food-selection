# random-food-selection
an application that displays a random fast food option for when you can't decide what to get

## What I used
Utilized JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to create the app

All the food locations were scraped using a Python food scraper 

Example Here: https://github.com/bryce-guglietti/foodscraper/blob/main/foodscraper.py

## Notes
Future updates incluede: a map to the nearest location, menu items, and dietary options
